## Overview

This Flask-based real-time chat application leverages Socket.IO for WebSocket connections. It allows users to create or join chat rooms and engage in real-time conversations.

## Application Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main application code.
- `templates/`: Stores HTML templates.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS and JavaScript.

## Workflow

### 1. Application Setup

- Flask and Socket.IO are initialized.
- A `rooms` dictionary is created to store information about active chat rooms.

### 2. Generating Unique Room Codes

- The `generate_unique_code(length)` function ensures each room has a unique identifier.

### 3. Home Route

1. The home route handles both GET and POST requests.

2. It starts by clearing any existing session data to ensure a clean slate.

3. When a POST request is received (form submission), it performs the following steps:

   - It retrieves the submitted name and code from the form.
   - Checks if the user chose to join or create a room.
   - Validates input with conditional checks.
   
   <strong>Conditions:</strong>
   - If name is not provided, it renders the "home.html" template with an error message.
   - If the user chooses to join and no room code is provided, it renders the template with an error.
   - It then either initializes the room variable with the provided code or generates a new unique code if the user chooses to create a room.
   - If the room does not exist, it renders the template with an error message.
   - It then sets session variables for room and name.
   - Finally, it redirects the user to the "room" route.

4. If it receives a GET request (initial page load), it renders the "home.html" template without any further processing.

This workflow ensures that users can join existing rooms or create new ones, and that all inputs are properly validated. It also maintains user sessions for future interactions.


### 4. Room Route

1. The room route handles GET requests.

2. It starts by retrieving the room code and user name from the session.

3. It then checks the following conditions:

    - If the room code is not available in the session.
    - If the user name is not available in the session.
    - If the room code is not present in the rooms dictionary (meaning the room does not exist).

4. If any of these conditions are met, it redirects the user back to the home page.

5. If none of the conditions are met, it renders the "room.html" template with the room code and the existing messages for that room.


### 5. Socket.IO Events

#### Connect Event

1. The connect event is triggered when a user connects to the server.

2. It starts by retrieving the room code and user name from the session.

3. It then checks if both the room and name are available.

4. If the room is not in the rooms dictionary, it leaves the room.

5. If the room exists, it performs the following actions:

   - Joins the user to the specified room.
   - Notifies the room that the user has entered.
   - Increments the member count for the room.
   - Logs a message indicating the user and room joined.


#### Message Event

1. The message event is triggered when a new message is sent.

2. It first retrieves the room code from the session.

3. It then checks if the room exists in the rooms dictionary.

4. If the room exists, it performs the following actions:

   - Creates a content dictionary with the user name and message content.
   - Broadcasts the message to all users in the room.
   - Appends the message to the room's message history.
   - Logs a message indicating the user and message sent.

```python
# Create a content dictionary with the user name and message content
content = {
    "name": session.get("name"),
    "message": data["data"]
}

# Send the message to all users in the room
send(content, to=room)

# Append the message to the room's message history
rooms[room]["messages"].append(content)

# Print a log message indicating the user and message sent
print(f"{session.get('name')} said: {data['data']}")
````

#### Disconnect Event

1. The disconnect event is triggered when a user disconnects from the server.

2. It starts by retrieving the room code and user name from the session.

3. It leaves the room.

4. If the room exists in the rooms dictionary, it performs the following actions:

   - Decrements the member count for the room.
   - If there are no more members in the room, deletes the room.
   - Notifies the room that the user has left.

5. Logs a message indicating the user and room left.


### 6. User Interaction

1. **Launching the Application**
   - The user runs the application with `python main.py`.

2. **Accessing the Application**
   - Users access the application through a web browser.

3. **Entering Name and Room Code**
   - Users enter their name and optionally choose to join an existing room by providing a room code.

4. **Joining or Creating a Room**
   - If the user chooses to join an existing room, the provided room code is validated.
   - If the user chooses to create a room, a unique room code is generated.

5. **Entering the Chat Room**
   - Authenticated users are redirected to the chat room.

6. **Real-Time Chat**
   - Users can now send and receive messages in real-time.

7. **Disconnecting**
   - When a user leaves the room or closes the application, a disconnect event is triggered. The room is updated accordingly.

## Conclusion

This detailed workflow emphasizes the role of session management in maintaining user state throughout the application. It ensures that users remain authenticated within their chosen rooms.
